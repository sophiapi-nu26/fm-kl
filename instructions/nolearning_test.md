Great idea. Do a **closed-form, no-learning** validation where (p) and (q) are generated by two different linear fields. Everything becomes analytic, so you can separate math from numerics and see the identity work non-trivially.

# Setup

* Work in (d=2).
* Pick two scalar schedules:

  * (a_u(t)) for (p) (e.g. (a_u(t)=\sin(\pi t))).
  * (a_v(t)) for (q) (e.g. (a_v(t)=0.3\sin(\pi t)+0.2)).
* Define
  [
  A_u(t)=\int_0^t a_u(s),ds,\qquad A_v(t)=\int_0^t a_v(s),ds,
  ]
  [
  \sigma_p^2(t)=e^{2A_u(t)},\qquad \sigma_q^2(t)=e^{2A_v(t)}.
  ]
  Then (p_t=\mathcal N(0,\sigma_p^2 I)), (q_t=\mathcal N(0,\sigma_q^2 I)).

# LHS (closed form)

KL between zero-mean isotropic Gaussians:
[
\mathrm{KL}(p_t|q_t)=\frac{d}{2}\Big(r(t)-1-\log r(t)\Big),
\quad r(t)=\frac{\sigma_p^2(t)}{\sigma_q^2(t)}=e^{2,(A_u(t)-A_v(t))}.
]
With (d=2): (\mathrm{KL}(t)=r-1-\log r).

# RHS integrand (closed form)

For linear fields (u(x,t)=a_u(t)x) and (v(x,t)=a_v(t)x),
[
\nabla\log p_t(x)=-\frac{x}{\sigma_p^2(t)},\qquad
\nabla\log q_t(x)=-\frac{x}{\sigma_q^2(t)}.
]
Hence
[
(u-v)^\top(\nabla\log p_t-\nabla\log q_t)
=(a_u-a_v),|x|^2\Big(\frac{1}{\sigma_q^2}-\frac{1}{\sigma_p^2}\Big).
]
Taking expectation under (x\sim p_t) (where (\mathbb E|x|^2=d,\sigma_p^2)):
[
g(t)\equiv\mathbb E_{p_t}[(u-v)^\top(\nabla\log p_t-\nabla\log q_t)]
= d,(a_u(t)-a_v(t))\Big(\frac{\sigma_p^2(t)}{\sigma_q^2(t)}-1\Big).
]
With (d=2):
[
g(t)=2,(a_u-a_v)\big(r(t)-1\big).
]

# Identity to check

[
\mathrm{KL}(p_t|q_t)=\int_0^t g(s),ds.
]

# What to implement (clean test)

1. **Closed forms.** Implement (a_u,a_v,A_u,A_v,\sigma_p^2,\sigma_q^2,r(t)).
2. **LHS curve.** Evaluate (\mathrm{KL}(t)=r-1-\log r) on a grid (t_k).
3. **RHS integrand.** Evaluate (g(t)=2,(a_u-a_v)(r-1)) on the same grid; integrate over time (trapezoid/Simpson) to get (R(t)).
4. **Compare.** Plot (\mathrm{KL}(t)) and (R(t)); they should coincide (up to quadrature error).

# Stronger cross-checks (still analytic)

* **Derivative check:** finite-difference (\frac{d}{dt}\mathrm{KL}(t)) from the closed-form LHS and verify it matches (g(t)) pointwise.
* **Different schedules:** try e.g. (a_v(t)=0.3\sin(2\pi t)+0.2) or (a_v(t)=t-\tfrac12) to get qualitatively different curves; the identity must continue to hold.

# Optional: exercise your ODE code without learning

If you want to validate the *pipeline* too (not just the formulas), set (v_\theta\equiv v) and:

* Compute (q_t) via your **backward ODE + divergence** and ensure (\log q_t) and (\nabla\log q_t) match the Gaussian formulas above ((-x/\sigma_q^2)).
* Estimate (g(t)) by Monte Carlo using your usual code; verify it matches the closed-form (g(t)) and that (\int_0^t g = \mathrm{KL}(t)).

This test is non-trivial (since (a_u\neq a_v), both sides are clearly away from 0), purely analytic, and will decisively confirm the identity—and your implementation—without any learning noise.
